   <summary> My Favorite song lyrics from the album</h2></summary>
   <li>
      <strong>
         Smashed his face
         He didn't move
         I hit him again
         He didn't scream
         Cut his throat
         He didn't bleed
         Stabbed his chest
         He didn't bleed
         He stared at me
         His face was a mess
         Die, die, die, you fuck!
         Die, die, die, you fuck!
         
         I dismembered him
         He didn't smell
         He stared at me
         His face was a mess
         I stabbed him again
         Die, die, you fuck!
         Die, die, die, die, you fuck!
